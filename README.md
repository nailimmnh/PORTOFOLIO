# 🚀 Nailiyatul Mamnunah's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! 🎉 This repository is a collection of various projects, explorations, and learnings across different technology domains. Over time, I will continue adding more projects from various categories, including:

- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**  
- 📊 **Data Analytics & Visualization**  
- And many more!  

## 🐂 Repository Structure  
Currently, this repository contains multiple categories, each with its own dedicated folder. Some available portfolios:  

### 🔹 [Machine Learning Portfolio](MachineLearningPortofolio/README.md)  
Contains my explorations in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, using **Python**, **SQL**, and libraries such as **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. Projects cover data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and reporting. SQL is used for structured data extraction and transformation in data-driven tasks.

*(More categories coming soon! Stay tuned! 🚀)*  

## 📌 Notes  
- All code, notebooks, and projects in this repository are created as part of my learning and exploration.  
- If you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, feel free to open an **Issue** or contact me via GitHub!
